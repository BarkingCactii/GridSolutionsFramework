 *
 * THIS OPEN SOURCE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") DEFINES THE RIGHTS OF USE,REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION,
 * MODIFICATION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER SOFTWARE ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY THE
 * TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY, A CORPORATE AGENCY AND INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
 * ("GOVERNMENT AGENCY"). GOVERNMENT AGENCY IS AN INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT
 * DISTRIBUTIONS OR REDISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. ANYONE WHO USES, REPRODUCES, DISTRIBUTES,
 * MODIFIES OR REDISTRIBUTES THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, AS DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT
 * ACTION, ACCEPTING IN FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
 * 
 * 1. DEFINITIONS
 * 
 * A. "Contributor" means Government Agency, as the developer of the Original Software, and any entity
 * that makes a Modification.
 * 
 * B. "Covered Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
 * the use or sale of its Modification alone or when combined with the Subject Software.
 * 
 * C. "Display" means the showing of a copy of the Subject Software, either directly or by means of an
 * image, or any other device.
 * 
 * D. "Distribution" means conveyance or transfer of the Subject Software, regardless of means, to
 * another.
 * 
 * E. "Larger Work" means computer software that combines Subject Software, or portions thereof, with
 * software separate from the Subject Software that is not governed by the terms of this Agreement.
 * 
 * F. "Modification" means any alteration of, including addition to or deletion from, the substance or
 * structure of either the Original Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
 * term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC § 101. However, the act of including Subject Software
 * as part of a Larger Work does not in and of itself constitute a Modification.
 * 
 * G. "Original Software" means the computer software first released under this Agreement by Government
 * Agency, including source code, object code and accompanying documentation, if any.
 * 
 * H. "Recipient" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software under this Agreement, including all
 * Contributors.
 * 
 * I. "Redistribution" means Distribution of the Subject Software after a Modification has been made.
 * 
 * J. "Reproduction" means the making of a counterpart, image or copy of the Subject Software.

 * 
 * 3. Reproduction
 * 
 * 4. Modification
 * 
 * 5. Redistribution
 * 
 * 6. Display
 *

 * 1. Use
 * 
 * 2. Distribution
 * 
 * 3. Reproduction
 * 
 * 4. Sale
 * 
 * 5. Offer for Sale
 * 
 * C. The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a Contributor's Modification
 * and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the Contributor, the addition of
 * such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered Patents. It does not apply to
 * any other combinations that include a Modification. 
 * 
 * D. The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those same rights.
 * Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 * 
 * 3. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT
 * 
 * A. Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made under this Agreement except for

 * medium customarily used for software exchange.
 * 
 * B. Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently in the Subject
 * Software:
 * 
 * No copyright is claimed pursuant to 17 USC § 105. All Other Rights Reserved.
 * 
 * C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and
 * must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
 * subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
 * requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations
 * made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and

 * the Contributor who added the notice.
 * 
 * E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional,
 * advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any
 * prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial
 * advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.
 * 
 * F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient,
 * upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the
 * following website: https://naspi.tva.com/Registration/. Recipient's name and personal information
 * shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is
 * requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access the
 * Modification.
 * 
 * G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification does not violate any existing agreements,
 * regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights
 * conveyed by this Agreement.
 * 
 * H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
 * liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so,
 * however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a
 * Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
 * obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government
 * Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support,
 * indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.
 * 
 * I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
 * governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
 * case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work
 * is subject to this Agreement.
 * 
 * J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
 * any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the
 * U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under
 * U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if
 * required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.
 * 
 * 4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES; WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION
 * 
 * A. No Warranty: THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

 * FREE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT DOCUMENTATION, IF PROVIDED, WILL CONFORM TO THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. THIS
 * AGREEMENT DOES NOT, IN ANY MANNER, CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR
 * RECIPIENT OF ANY RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS

 * "AS IS."
 * 
 * B. Waiver and Indemnity: RECIPIENT AGREES TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT AGENCY, ITS
 * AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT. IF RECIPIENT'S USE

                                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                                         Version 3, 29 June 2007

                       Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3
of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
  "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a
  Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not
  otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
  "Linked Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
  Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for
  the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from
  the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3
  of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or
  data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
      Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the
  Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
  inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the
      Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
  restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that
      the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice
      for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the
      GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
          Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
          or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
          Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
          Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is
          one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer 
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
          interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such
      information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining
      or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
      the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding
      Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
      manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library
  together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License,
  and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with
      any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
      explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that
  a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to
  it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of
  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
  specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the
  GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version
  is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
